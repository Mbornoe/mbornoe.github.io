During my PhD I am obligated to take 3-6 months in a foreign research environment, which I really look forward to as I enjoy travelling to other countries both privately both also with professionally purposes. In this case I have the chance to travel and participate in a group that specializes in my exact field of study. With all due respect to Aalborg University and the group I am actively working in now, it is just so very different compared to e.g. the CVRR-LISA group led by Mohan Trivedi, where I was a visiting scholar for 7-months during my Master’s. In CVRR-LISA everyone is working together in small “groups”, e.g. 1-3 people, on different topics, but the major difference is that the different topics are all within the Driving Assistance Systems (DAS) field of study. In the Visual Analysis of People Lab at Aalborg University, where I am doing my PhD, I am together with one other PhD student, Chris Bahnsen, the only ones working on traffic related topics. The remaining of the group are spread out across other computer vision areas, e.g. inspection of poultry entrails, pig slaughterhouse robots, pain recognition based on the face, quality control of high-end consumer products, and activity recognition in sport arenas.


The below table is just a small selection of some of the labs I find interesting based on both their research and location. There are so many of them, that it is so time-consuming compiling a comprehensive list.

## Computer Vision and Robotics Research Laboratory & Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (CVRR-LISA) {#cvrr-lisa}

##### Director: Professor Mohan Manubhai Trivedi &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=68) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LkONrRAAAAAJ)

##### University: University of California, San Diego

##### Location: [San Diego, United States of America](https://goo.gl/maps/uUytUmYByDu)

##### Link: [http://cvrr.ucsd.edu](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu)

#### Description
The laboratory which in 2015 won the IEEE ITS Institutional Lead Award for being significant contributions to research in ITS related fields (ITS Research Award), developed and deployed successful ITS systems or implementations (ITS Application Award), and demonstrated leadership in promoting ITS technologies (ITS Institutional Lead Award). I was a visiting scholar in this lab during my Master's in 2014-2015, where I was able to work together with some incredible bright and amazing students, e.g. Eshed Ohn-Bar who might be the cleverest and coolest PhD student I have ever met. Though I am happy to see Eshed moved on to do fantastic research at Carnegie Mellon University, this laboratory will always be attractive due to the incredible visionary Professor Mohan M. Trivedi, who to some extend is one of the main reasons I ever choose to continue  in the academia world as a PhD student. The only reason I am a little reluctant of this lab is probably that I have already stayed there and I am considering challenging myself somewhere else.

## Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS-CVC) {#adas-cvc}

##### Director: Dr Antonio M. López &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](http://www.cvc.uab.es/%7Eantonio/site/) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=3LYW1zMAAAAJ)

##### University: Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona 

##### Location: [Barcelona, Spain](https://goo.gl/maps/89Lxe71weyA2)

##### Link: [http://adas.cvc.uab.es](http://adas.cvc.uab.es)

#### Description
The intro on their own website is copied to below quote, which I think provides a good idea of what this group aim to do as well as what direction I want to go with my PhD and career.

> Intelligent vehicles refer to cars, trucks, buses, etc. on which sensors and control systems have been integrated in order to assist the driving task, hence their name Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The aim is to combine sensors and algorithms to understand the vehicle environment so that the driver can receive assistance or be warned of potential hazards. Vision is the most important sense employed for driving, therefore cameras are the most used sensor in these systems.

My colleague at Aalborg University, Chris Bahnsen, had a 3-months stay in this group and has talked nice about it. Furthermore, it could be an obvious way of improving my high school Spanish - which is pretty bad...

## Uber Advanced Technologies Group Toronto (Uber ATG) {#uber-atg}

##### Director: Professor Raquel Urtasun &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jyxO2akAAAAJ)

##### University: University of Toronto

##### Location: Toronto, Canada

##### Link: [https://www.uber.com/info/atg/](https://www.uber.com/info/atg/)

#### Description
As for Professor Trivedi, Professor Raquel Urtasun needs no further introduction which is best illustrated by quickly scrolling down through her Highlights and News feed on her profile page and counting the multiple papers accepted at CVPR, ICRA, ICLR, ICCV, BMVC, and PAMI. In February 2017 she was awarded the NSERC EWR Steacie Fellowship for her work on Machine Perception for self-driving cars. This is given each year to the top 6 Scientists and Engineers in Canada. She got the award at a ceremony where Justin Trudeau were present - yep that's right, the Prime Minister of Canada. The first time I heard about Professor Urtasun was in relation to the widely known Kitti Benchmark Suite which she was highly involved in creating together with prominent names, i.e. Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz and Christoph Stiller. At IV2016 in Gothenburg I was workshop co-organizer for the [VIVA-challenge](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/vivachallenge/), we were fortunate to have Professor Urtasun to come and give a talk about how the Kitti benchmark was created as well as her exciting research. In May 1st 2017 Professor Urtasun joined Uber as Head of Uber ATG Toronto. However, the group to apply to is her group at the University of Toronto. But I expect the research to be closely linked towards the Uber ATG, so calling this research group the Uber ATG group might not be completely  exact.

I really think this is one of the strongest and coolest groups in the world and it really fits my research and interests well, but the publications requirements are also quite high.

## MIT AgeLab - Advanced Vehicle Technologyy (AVT) Consortium {#mit-avg}

##### Project Contact: Dr Bryan Reimer &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](http://web.mit.edu/reimer/www/) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=NfyVi8AAAAAJ)

##### University: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

##### Location: [Cambridge, United States of America](https://goo.gl/maps/Ea9naZG3ysn)

##### Link: [http://agelab.mit.edu/avt](http://agelab.mit.edu/avt)

#### Description
Similar to the Uber ATG group lead by Professor Urtasun, it seems that AVT at Mit AgeLab are also somehow industry oriented including partners such as Jaguar land Rover, Toyota, and of course my favourite, Tesla. I think they give a good introduction of what their aims are at their site, so I inserted it here:

>The Advanced Vehicle Technology (AVT) Consortium was launched in September 2015 with the goal of achieving a data-driven understanding of how drivers leverage vehicle automation, driver assistance technologies, and the range of in-vehicle and portable technologies for connectivity and infotainment. Using advanced computer-vision software and big data analytics, researchers are gathering data to quantify drivers’ actions, such as how they respond to various driving situations and perform other actions like eating or having conversations behind the wheel. The research is studying the moments when control transfers from the driver to the car and back again, as well as how drivers respond to alarms (lane keeping, forward collision, proximity detectors, etc.) and leverage technologies (e.g., semi-autonomous parking assistance, assisted cruise control, vehicle infotainment and communications systems, smartphones and more).

Similar to the group in Toronto, I sincerely  think there is a lot of research going on here that really fits me well. As previous mentioned they have already gained quite a few industrial partners, who provided them with a lot of exiting equipment, which we are nowhere near in Aalborg, so actually being able to develop directly to a product is so exciting! And finally of course - This is MIT! A potential chance of fulfilling my boyhood dream of standing in the Killian Court and looking at the Great Dome with joy.

## Real-Time Intelligent Systems (RTIS) Laboratory {#unlv-RTIS}

##### Project Contact: Professor Brendan Morris &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](http://www.ee.unlv.edu/~b1morris/) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uFH3IMwAAAAJ)

##### University: University of Nevada, Las Vegas

##### Link: [http://rtis.oit.unlv.edu/index.html](http://rtis.oit.unlv.edu/index.html)

#### Description
Compared to some of the other groups mentioned in this overview, this group is not particular big, in fact it is quite similar in the quantity to the lab we have in Aalborg. The main reason I seriously consider this group is due to Professor Brendan Morris, who is the coolest guy I ever met in the field of DAS and computer vision. He is an alumni from CVRR-LISA, UCSD and I have, to my big satisfaction, read almost every paper he published.  His group, RTIS, combines computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition to develop "real" solutions.  Intelligent systems are those that are able to observe the world, learn from these observations, and understand the environment. The real-time systems are designed to operate continuously and robustly through all operating modes.

I have been fortunate enough to meet and talk to him multiple times at IV and ISVC, where he is highly involved in various committees. My hope would be to work directly with Professor Morris as I like his very intelligent and direct approach for research whilst keeping an open mind for ideas, also I think I can learn quite a lot from him on how to "make it" in the field of computer vision.

## CMU Computer Vision Group (CMU CVG) {#cmu-cvg}

##### Director: Multiple

##### University: Carnegie Mellon University

##### Location: Pittsburgh, United States of America

##### Link: [http://vision.ri.cmu.edu/](http://vision.ri.cmu.edu/)

#### Description
So first off, I want to clear up for the missing definition of the exact director of the group. Which is actually not entirely clear to me, as the CMU CVG group look at wide spectrum of different computer vision challenges, e.g. including  object recognition and scene understanding (Gupta, Ramanan, Bagnell, Hebert, Kanade); 3D geometry and reconstruction (Kaess, Narasimhan, Lucey, Sheikh, Kanade); motion analysis and tracking (Ramanan, Gupta, Lucey, De la Torre, Kitani, Sheikh); physics-based vision (Narasimhan); and analysis of 3D data (Hebert, Huber). I previously mentioned Eshed Ohn-bar, whom I met at CVRR-LISA a few years back, he is currently working with Kris Kitani here, which is actually how CMU CVG were brought to my attention. Object recognition and scene understanding fits my thesis and me quite well. I am however a little unsure how much they have actually worked on this in relation to traffic surveillance or DAS, based on their "about us" page, it seems like most of the work they have done in the segment of motion analysis of tracking techniques. 

Overall I think this is a lab I want to look more into as it looks quite interesting from the outside. I do however need to start reading a little more of the previous work, to get a better feeling of how well this lab actually fits me.

## Princeton Vision & Robotics (PVR) {#pvr}

##### Directors: Professor Thomas Funkhouser &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~funk/) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=BghVDhgAAAAJ) & Professor Olga Russakovsky &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TB5OwW8AAAAJ)

##### University: Princeton University

##### Location: Princeton, United States of America

##### Link: [http://3dvision.princeton.edu](http://3dvision.princeton.edu)

#### Description
These guys just got eight (8!!) research papers accepted to CVPR17 - impressive. Based on their publications it seems they are quite interested in 3D Deep Learning, RGB-D Recognition and Reconstruction, Deep Learning for Robotics, Place-centric 3D Context Representation, Synthesis for Analysis, Big Data Robotics, Autonomous Driving, Robot Learning, Large-scale Crowd-sourcing, and Petascale Big Data. Obviously I would be most interested in the Autonomous driving part, where they a few years ago published a paper about their DeepDriving system, which I find quite fascinating. In our InDeV Project we capture video with 2 modalities, namely RGB and thermal camera. The PVR group do not per se specialize in thermal camera, but they do however do high quality work on RGB-D recognition, which might be interesting for me, though I might switch the depth channel out with some thermal data instead, and apply it with the purpose of scene understanding as well as recognition and tracking.

## VisLab {#vislab}

##### Director: Dr Alberto Broggi &nbsp; &nbsp;[Profile](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~funk/) &nbsp; &nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=QeWNDkgAAAAJ)

##### University: University of Parma

##### Location: Parma, Germany

##### Link: [http://vislab.it](http://vislab.it)

#### Description
So, if you are not familiar with VisLab, you should definitely take a close look at Dr Broggi's group, he might be one of the most prominent names in this field of study. I think they were one of the first groups I ever heard of doing academic research for vision on vehicles. According to their website, they have been developing vehicle prototypes spanning from DAS to automated driving for the past 20+ years. In 1998 the VisLab designed and implemented the "ARGO" prototype  vehicle, which is a autonomous passenger car that have been exhaustively tested for more than 2000 km (94% of which in autonomous mode) on Italian highways, together with regular traffic.  ARGO is considered one of the milestones of vehicular robotics worldwide. This is pretty amazing... I was 8 years old at this point, and a car had already driven 2000 km somehow autonomously. Since then, VisLab have continued making amazing research as well as keep pushing the boundaries with they innovative vehicle prototypes. 

I find this lab quite interesting and it might be the best and most well known choice in Europe. Similar to the ADAS-CVC (Barcelona), I am a little reluctant as I do not speak a word Italian, which of course can be considered a positive chance to actually learn some, but when travelling alone I fear that there is high risk of becoming more socially isolated due to this.

## Berkeley DeepDrive Center (DeepDrive) {#deepdrive}

##### Link: [https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu](https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu)

#### Description
I know that I already mentioned and described some of the above as being the strongest groups in the world, so it might not come as a surplice  that I also define this group as one of the strongest one as well. However, I think this group actually is just slightly in front of some of the others. It might be because they are better and showcasing themselves, I do not know. Anyways, they have quite a few projects going on, e.g. Deep Reinforcement Learning, Outdoor Semantic Scene Segmentation via Multi-modal Sensors, 3D Object detection based on Lidar and Camera fusion; and so many more! But especially these 3 topics are close to perfect matches for the research I am currently doing. Reinforcement Learning is something we are trying to do in the InDeV project, in the same project we have already captured ALOT of multi-modal data (RGB and thermal) across Europe. Finally, we are currently investigating different Lidars with the purpose of buying one. So doing 3D object detection based on Lidar and camera fusion is right up my research alley the coming year!
