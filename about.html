My name is Morten Bornø Jensen and I am a PhD student at Aalborg University, Denmark, where I am also born and raised.  I have received by Master's Degree in Computer vision from Aalborg University in 2015. Directly after graduation I began working in the "Visual Analysis of People Laboratory" (VAP) at Aalborg University who is led by Professor Thomas B. Moeslund, who was also supervising my master's thesis. My PhD thesis revolves around automatic analysis of the vulnerable road users (VRU) in the traffic scene, which mainly include the following research topics: Large scaled multi-modal and multi-view data collection in traffic intersections, VRU classification in the traffic scene using deep learning based on multi- modal and multi-view data, and finally using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to generate traffic usage reports in roundabouts and intersections. If you want to read more about my PhD thesis, I encourage you to read <a href="https://mbornoe.github.io/2017/welcome-to-my-blog/">my very first blog post</a>.

My big research interest in computer vision and image processing applied to traffic research was spawned during my Master’s Degree, where I was a visiting graduate researcher at the prominent, “Computer Vision and Robotics Research Laboratory” (CVRR) at University of California, San Diego. My field of study at CVRR was Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS), where I worked on utilizing stereo-vision for object detection in both day- and nighttime and detecting traffic lights in the traffic scene.

My education has been build on “Problem Based Learning”, which has developed my skills of how to work in a team, being analytic and find constructive way to evaluate a problem with the purpose of finding the best possible solution. This approach has already proven beneficial at my former job as a Student Software Developer at Intel Mobile Communications.
